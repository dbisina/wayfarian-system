# Wayfarian Account Deletion & Data Requests

_Last updated: 16 November 2025_

We believe you should have full control over your data. This page describes how to remove your Wayfarian Adventures account, what happens afterward, and how to request a copy of your data.

## 1. What gets removed

Deleting your account will:

- Remove your profile details (name, email, avatar, preferences) from our systems.
- Remove or anonymize the journeys, groups, invitations, and chat entries you created.
- Deactivate any active groups for which you are the sole member. If you are the creator of a group that still has multiple members, please transfer ownership or archive the group before requesting deletion.
- Revoke access tokens tied to the deleted account across all devices.

Diagnostic logs that must be retained for security, anti-fraud, or legal reasons may be stored for up to 18 months but are decoupled from your identity.

## 2. How to delete your account

Until the self-service deletion button ships in the mobile app, please follow the manual process below:

1. Send an email to **wayfarian.ezadventures@gmail.com** with the subject line `Delete my Wayfarian account`.
2. Use the same email address that is linked to your Wayfarian profile so we can verify ownership. If that’s not possible, include the Google Account UID that appears under `Settings → Profile → Account ID` in the app.
3. Confirm that you understand the deletion is permanent and include a brief statement that you wish to remove your data.
4. (Optional) Let us know if you need a copy of your journey history before deletion.

We will acknowledge the request within 2 business days and complete the deletion within 30 days, typically much sooner. You will receive a confirmation email once the process is done.

## 3. Requesting a data export

If you want a copy of your data before deleting your account:

1. Email **wayfarian.ezadventures@gmail.com** with the subject `Wayfarian data export`.
2. Specify the email address tied to your account, and whether you want the full dataset or a specific date range/journey.
3. We will send you a secure download link containing JSON/CSV exports of your profile, journeys, and group activity logs.

Export requests are processed within 30 days, usually faster.

## 4. Need help transferring groups?

If you are the creator of a group that still has active members, you have two options before deleting your account:

- **Transfer ownership**: In the app, open the group, go to `Members`, and promote another member to owner. Then archive or leave the group.
- **Archive the group**: If you are the only active member left, archive the group from the group settings screen so no data is orphaned when you delete your account.

If you have trouble completing either step, mention it in your deletion email and our support team will help migrate the data.
