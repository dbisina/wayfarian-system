# Google Play Console: Closed Test Declaration Answers

Here are professional, detailed responses you can use for your Closed Testing declaration.

## 1. How did you recruit users for your closed test?
**Limit: 300 chars**

> We recruited a diverse group of testers comprising internal developers, friends, and family via direct invitations and social media. We specifically targeted individuals who travel frequently or enjoy group activities (hiking, road trips) to ensure our user base matched Wayfarian's target demographic.

## 2. Describe the engagement you received from testers during your closed test
**Limit: 300 chars**

> Testers were highly engaged, using the app daily to track simulated and real-world journeys. They tested core features like real-time location sharing, chat, and media uploads. Usage aligned with expectations, with activity spikes during weekends. We received constant feedback on stability and UI flow.

## 3. Provide a summary of the feedback that you received from testers. Include how you collected the feedback.
**Limit: 300 chars**

> We collected feedback via email and direct messaging. Testers praised the location accuracy but identified bugs in the Sign-In flow (specifically Google/Apple auth), which we have now fixed. Users also suggested better battery management for long trips. We have implemented these fixes in the latest build.

## 4. Describe how your app provides value to users
**Limit: 1000 chars (approx)**

> Wayfarian eliminates the fragmentation of modern group travel. Instead of switching between map apps for location, messaging apps for coordination, and cloud storage for photos, Wayfarian unifies these into a single "Journey" concept.
>
> **Key Value Propositions:**
> *   **Real-time Safety**: Always know where your group members are on a shared map.
> *   **Unified Timeline**: Chat messages, photos, and location updates appear in a single chronological stream.
> *   **Journey Logging**: Automatically creates a nostalgic log of your trip with stats like distance and speed.
>
> Users value the peace of mind knowing their friends are safe and the ease of reliving the adventure later.

## 5. How many installs do you expect your app to have in your first year?
> **0 – 10K**
> *(This is the standard and most realistic option for a new app launch to pass review quickly).*

## 6. What changes did you make to your app based on what you learned during your closed test?
**Limit: 300 chars**

> Based on tester feedback, we prioritized fixing a critical crash on iOS during Google Sign-In and resolved authentication errors with AppleID. We also optimized battery usage for background location tracking and improved the UI for the 'Journey' timeline to make it more intuitive during travel.

## 7. How did you decide that your app is ready for production?
**Limit: 300 chars**

> We monitored crash-free rates and user retention during the closed test. After resolving the critical authentication blockers and receiving confirmation from testers that the core 'Journey' flow is stable and reliable in real-world conditions, we determined the app is ready for a wider release.
