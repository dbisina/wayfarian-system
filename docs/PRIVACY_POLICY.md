# Wayfarian Privacy Policy

_Last updated: 16 November 2025_

Wayfarian Adventures ("Wayfarian", "we", "our") helps small groups plan, track, and relive shared journeys. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use the Wayfarian mobile application, public APIs, and related services (collectively, the "Service"). By creating an account or otherwise using Wayfarian you agree to the practices described here.

If you have any questions, please reach out to **wayfarian.ezadventures@gmail.com**.

## 1. Information we collect

We only collect information that is necessary to deliver core functionality:

| Category | Examples | Source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Account information | Name, email address, profile photo, preferred units, and authentication tokens | Provided by you during sign-up or profile edits, or via federated identity providers such as Google |
| Journey and group data | Group names, membership lists, chat snippets, events, invitations, journey distance/time, waypoints, media that you upload during a ride | Created by you and other group members while using the app |
| Location signals | Foreground GPS coordinates, heading, speed, device motion metadata while you have an active journey session | Recorded from the device sensors with your permission |
| Device & usage data | Device model, OS version, app version, crash logs, push notification tokens, in-app interactions | Automatically collected to keep the app stable and secure |
| Support interactions | Messages you send to support@wayfarian.app, feedback forms, or survey responses | Provided by you |

We do **not** intentionally collect sensitive personal information or data from children under 13. If we learn that we inadvertently collected such data, we will delete it.

## 2. How we use information

We use your data to:

- Authenticate you and keep your sessions secure.
- Create and maintain groups, journeys, invitations, events, and ride statistics.
- Visualize progress on maps and timelines, including real-time positions for opted-in group rides.
- Send transactional notifications (journey updates, invites, reminders) and optional product tips.
- Monitor performance, debug crashes, and safeguard the Service against abuse.
- Comply with legal obligations and enforce our Terms.

## 3. Legal bases

For users located in the European Economic Area (EEA) or United Kingdom, we process personal data under the following legal bases: (a) performance of a contract (providing the Service), (b) legitimate interests (protecting our platform, measuring engagement), and (c) consent (collecting precise location, sending optional marketing messages).

## 4. How we share information

We do not sell your personal data. We share it only with:

- **Service providers** that power authentication, hosting, analytics, messaging, and geospatial features. Core vendors today include Firebase Authentication & Firestore (Google LLC), Expo Application Services (EAS), Google Maps Platform, and Sentry crash analytics.
- **Group members** you explicitly collaborate with inside the app (e.g., your live location during a group journey).
- **Legal authorities** if required to comply with applicable law or to protect the rights, property, or safety of Wayfarian, our users, or others.

Each vendor is bound by confidentiality and data-processing agreements that restrict how they may use your data.

## 5. Data retention

- Account profiles, groups, and journey history are retained while your account is active. When you delete your account we remove or irreversibly anonymize associated records within 30 days, except where we must keep limited logs to satisfy legal requirements.
- Location and telemetry data tied to journeys is retained for the lifetime of the journey record unless you delete it manually.
- Crash logs and diagnostics are stored for up to 18 months.

## 6. Your rights & choices

Depending on where you live, you may have rights to access, correct, export, or delete your personal data. You can:

- Review and update your profile inside the app (`Settings → Edit Profile`).
- Manage notification, location, and sensor permissions through your device OS settings.
- Delete individual journeys or groups inside the relevant screens.
- Request account deletion or data export by following the steps in [Account Deletion & Data Requests](./ACCOUNT_DELETION.md).

We will respond to verified requests within 30 days and sooner when feasible.

## 7. Children

Wayfarian is not directed to children under 13 (or the age required by your jurisdiction). If you believe we have collected information from a child, please contact us so we can remove it.

## 8. International transfers

We operate primarily from the United States but may process data on servers located in other regions through our vendors. We rely on standard contractual clauses and similar safeguards when transferring personal data internationally.

## 9. Changes to this policy

We may update this Privacy Policy periodically. When we make material changes, we will notify you inside the app or via email and update the "Last updated" date at the top of this page.

## 10. Contact us

For privacy questions, data requests, or security reports, email **wayfarian.ezadventures@gmail.com**. We aim to reply to every request within 2 business days.
